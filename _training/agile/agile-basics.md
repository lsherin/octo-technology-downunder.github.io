### DESCRIPTION
Agile methods are on the rise. Every one of us knows what it is, and if it's not yet the case for you, there's a plethora of books and online resources to do just that. Understanding agility is therefore possible and easily accessible. To see and understand how, through agile methods, acting to improve one's work environment, teamwork and the way one's organization works is a much more complicated and sometimes even more perilous matter. 
This training will allow you to pass from head to body, from knowledge to knowledge in action so that you can get to know what agile processes are all about in a holistic way. It will lead you to have a more accurate position on what they are and especially what they can bring to you in the singularity of your style and your context.
