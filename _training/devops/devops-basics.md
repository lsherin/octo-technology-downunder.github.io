### DESCRIPTION

The developers (Dev) and operators (Ops) are a bit like the Tom and Jerry of IT Engineering! But to achieve both the agility and operational excellence of the Web giants, these enemy brothers must work together effectively. Indeed, Dev and Ops have opposite objectives: innovation versus stability. 
The DevOps approach is based on four pillars: exploitable application architecture, infrastructure as code, continuous deployment and a culture of collaboration. DevOps reduces the time between the expression of the user requirement and the delivery of the corresponding application, with increased software quality. 
At the end of this day, you will have the keys to implementing a DevOps approach within your organization.
