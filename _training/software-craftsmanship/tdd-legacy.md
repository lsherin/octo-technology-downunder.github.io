### DESCRIPTION
Legacy code is a metaphor for talking about this code existing in our applications, difficult to maintain, often of poor quality and not automatically tested. This module trains developers in the practices of maintaining and evolving legacy code safely, so that they can find the paths back to high quality.

### PEDAGOGICAL OBJECTIVES
* Know how to understand code quality problems and apply code refactoring techniques
* Identify entry points to evolve legacy code while minimizing risks
* Apply techniques to set up automated tests around legacy code
* Assess the risks to choose an appropriate technical debt reduction strategy

### TARGET
* Development Project manager
* Developer
* A tester having a developing fiber
* Architect
* Technical Leader

### PRE-REQUISITES
* Programming and software engineering skills.
* Experience in test-driven development (TDD) and object-oriented programming is a plus.
* Having followed the "Quality of development with Test Driven Development" (TDD01) training would be a plus.

### PEDAGOGICAL METHOD
This training is mainly composed of practical exercises that will provide participants with tools that they can immediately put into practice in their current projects. 
Exchanges on participants' contexts and feedback from the trainer's experience, supplemented by theoretical contributions.

### STAKEHOLDER PROFILES
All our training courses are run by experienced and peer-recognized training consultants.

### EVALUATION METHODS
The evaluation of learning outcomes is carried out throughout the session through workshops and practical exercises. An evaluation is systematically carried out at the end of the session.
