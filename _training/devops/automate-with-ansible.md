### DESCRIPTION
As the last of the "Configuration Management"solutions, Ansible succeeded in asserting itself in front of its big brothers (Chief, Puppet, etc.) by proposing a simpler and less restrictive alternative solution. Ansible makes it easy and efficient to automate complex infrastructure implementation and application deployment. 

After describing the concepts around Ansible ("Configuration Management","Infrastructure as Code"), you will learn how to handle this tool, manage its playbooks, roles, modules, and how to apply them to your infrastructure. 

### PEDAGOGICAL OBJECTIVES
* Understand the organization of Ansible (roles, tasks, playbooks, modules, etc.)
* Know how to use and create playbooks to manage your infrastructure

### TARGET
* Developer
* Architect
* System Administrator

### PRE-REQUISITES
Basic knowledge of a Unix system (taking care in a terminal).

### PEDAGOGICAL METHOD
