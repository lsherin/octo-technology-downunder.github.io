### DESCRIPTION
Spark was born in 2009 in the AMPLab laboratory at the University of Berkeley. This framework offers a simpler programming model than Hadoop's MapReduce and above all faster with up to 100 times shorter runtimes. With Spark, developers can simply write complex distributed applications that enable faster decision making and real-time actions, applied to a wide variety of applications, architectures and industries. 
This training is aimed at developers who want to create and deploy complete and unique Big Data applications by combining batchs, streaming and interactive analytics across all data.
