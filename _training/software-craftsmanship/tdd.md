### DESCRIPTION
Test Driven Development (TDD) is a simple, elegant and effective programming technique that relies on a short feedback cycle: writing a test - making it pass - refactoring the code. This approach combines the advantage of a modular, readable design with the security of automated test coverage. At the end of this training, you will be able to write complete applications, supported by code in working order, particularly maintainable and scalable.

### PEDAGOGICAL OBJECTIVES
* Identify the advantages of TDD over other programming techniques (code then Unit Test)
* Developing a simple application with TDD
* Explain and illustrate the principles at work in this approach
* Use TDD on a new project
* Using specific TDD techniques on an existing project

### TARGET
* Development Project manager
* Developer
* A tester having a developing fiber
* Architect
* Technical Leader

### PRE-REQUISITES
* Knowledge of object programming.
* Basic experience in software development.

### PEDAGOGICAL METHOD
Practical training, aimed at acquiring know-how, based on practical exercises as well as exchanges and feedback of the trainer's practical experience.

### STAKEHOLDER PROFILES
All our training courses are run by experienced and peer-recognized training consultants.

### EVALUATION METHODS
The evaluation of learning outcomes is carried out throughout the session through workshops and practical exercises. An evaluation is systematically carried out at the end of the session.
