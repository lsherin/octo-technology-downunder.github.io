### Summary
A 4-day hands-on practical course in deploying and managing Couchbase Server clusters for core NoSQL database use-cases and workloads. Students learn and practice the main architectural concepts and procedures an administrator needs to know to operate Couchbase Server for real-time OLTP enterprise workloads.

### Description

This is a fast-paced technical practicum on Couchbase Server 4.5 from an Administration and Operations perspective. The course takes a use-case driven approach to learning NoSQL database server cluster deployment and operations.

Through instructor-led discussion, demonstrations and intensive hands-on labs, participants will develop an actual Couchbase server cluster and Proof of Concept (POC) modeled on typical use-cases for high performance mission-critical NoSQL databases.

The goal of the class is to get students immediately productive with Couchbase to develop working prototype cluster environments. Lab time will be from 40% to 60% or more, each day. Each student will be provided multiple VMs running in the cloud for hands-on practice setting up a live Couchbase cluster and learning how to configure, monitor and troubleshoot the cluster in realistic scenarios.

Each lab exercise builds progressive skills and “flight-time” in design and deployment of a Couchbase NoSQL Server cluster designed for handling core use-cases, and subjected to realistic workloads that take advantage of Couchbase Server's powerful capabilities and benefits.

The course incorporates best practices with insider tips and tricks drawn from hundreds of real customer uses-cases for how to deploy and manage production Couchbase clusters.  Students will receive documentation on how to set up a fully working Couchbase cluster across multiple datacenters and can recreate and practice on this prototype configuration in the Amazon Cloud after the class.

### Objectives

By the end of this course the student will be able to perform the most critical administrative tasks such as how to install and configure Couchbase Server 4.5, run benchmark testing against a realistic POC cluster while monitoring its health, cause auto-sharding of clusters, backup and restore a cluster, add and remove nodes, assign roles to nodes enabling MDS (Multi-Dimensional Scalability) and troubleshoot a live cluster. Each student will create their own fully functional 3-node Couchbase cluster in one data center and replicate the data via XDCR to a single node in another data center. The student will be able to demonstrate best practices and diagnose and resolve the top ten current operations issues.

### Audience

The course is intended for future Couchbase Administrators, DevOps engineers and Systems engineers. The class will be focused on technical concepts and hands-on labs. However, developers, managers and network administrators with an interest in Couchbase are also welcome to attend.

### Prerequisites

System administrator experience in one or more of the following: Win32, UNIX, Linux or DBA or other networking / virtualization / cloud technologies; experience with Linux systems administration skills using command line. No prior database experience is required; however, knowledge of relational database technology is helpful. No prior knowledge of Couchbase is required.  We strongly suggest Participants complete the following Couchbase online courses prior to class: CB020 and CB030.

### Additional Notes

Participation and attendance in class: since the class covers concepts at a rapid pace and because lab assignments are additive and progressive, it is important for students to devote their full attention to the training. If students miss one of the earlier labs or fail to complete all labs and be in attendance for all instruction this may prevent or reduce ability to complete subsequent labs and learn best practices.

Class duration: CS300 completion time may vary widely. Some groups or individual Participants may require a full 3.75 or 4 days to complete the labs, while others may complete the course and labs faster, in 3.5 days or even 3.25 days. This is especially true for smaller classes, or where Participants have substantial prior NoSQL server experience. It is not unusual for Participants to be able to complete the final labs by middle of Day 4. This is a good thing. It means the class and the students learned quickly, acquired skills faster than others, and had great success with Couchbase Server Administration. In some instances due to calendar constraints, CS300 scheduled in public sessions will be completed in 3 days by extending the training day by 1.5 hours, always covering the complete course and labs. And some enterprise customers who purchase CS300 onsite request that CS300 be completed in 3 days, which requires that class start at 8:30 and go to 6pm or 6:30. This variability in course duration is why we price on-site delivery of training the same whether 3-day or 4-day.
