This advanced course provides Java programmers a deep-dive into Hadoop application development. Students will learn how to design and develop efficient and effective MapReduce applications for Hadoop using the Hortonworks Data Platform, including how to implement combiners, partitioners, secondary sorts, custom input and output formats, joining large datasets, unit testing, and developing UDFs for Pig and Hive. Labs are run on a 7-node HDP 2.1 cluster running in a virtual machine that students can keep for use after the training.
