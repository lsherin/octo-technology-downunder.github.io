### DESCRIPTION
Cloud platforms are all moving towards a new deployment model to solve software dependency issues: the container. Its advantages are numerous. It isolates processes and acts as a basic brick that is assembled with other containers to create a complete architecture. This session trains the use of software containerization technologies using the Docker tool. Through this training, you will acquire advanced technical knowledge on Linux containers and the practical implementation of container-based application architectures.

### PEDAGOGICAL OBJECTIVES
* Find out what Linux Containers are
* Knowing how to use Docker and its command line tool
* Creating containers and launching programs in containers
* Using the Docker register and creating images using a Dockerfile
* Handling Docker container topology
* Discover the stakes involved in scaling up architectures based on Docker technology
* Handling Swarm and Kubernetes
* Deploy on Openshift
* Understand the challenges of application architecture in Docker and continuous integration issues

### PUBLIC TARGET
* Architect
* Developer
* Operator
* Director
* Integration manager

### PRE-REQUISITE
