### DESCRIPTION
Software makers know that code quality goes hand in hand with fast, simple and efficient development. The practices, principles and standards that define this quality are called the "Clean Code". They allow any team to create, maintain (or restore) a high quality code, and concern multiple aspects of programming: style conventions, naming rules, quality criteria of functions, classes, relationships between classes. At the end of this training, you will be able to implement the basic practices for obtaining a code of high quality, tested and flexible.

### PEDAGOGICAL OBJECTIVES
* Identify, explain and illustrate the main elements of the Clean Code.
* Use these standards on an example project, as well as on existing code
* Define the link between code quality and application scalability

### TARGET
* Development Project manager
* Developer
* A tester having a developing fiber
* Architect
* Technical Leader

### PRE-REQUISITES
* Knowledge of object programming.
* Basic experience in software development.
* Having followed the "Quality of development with Test Driven Development" (TDD01) training would be a plus.

### PEDAGOGICAL METHOD
Practical training, aimed at acquiring know-how, based on exercises as well as exchanges and feedback from the trainer's experience. 
Participants must bring several extracts of code they are working on or have worked on.

### STAKEHOLDER PROFILES
All our training courses are run by experienced and peer-recognized training consultants.

### EVALUATION METHODS
The evaluation of learning outcomes is carried out throughout the session through workshops and practical exercises. An evaluation is systematically carried out at the end of the session.
