### DESCRIPTION
With the technique of developer testing, code review is unanimously recognized by the industry as one of the best practices for quality development. Its direct and indirect benefits, which make it a key practice in software quality, are numerous: reducing the number of defects in the code, improving its structural quality, improving communication, training, contributing to a culture of quality. Surprisingly, this practice, which has arisen since the time of software development, is still relatively uncommon, except for the major software publishers. It is not without difficulty, as it requires a certain rigour in its development and the presence of active facilitators among the participants. This one-day training will enable your teams to acquire the essential practice of detecting problems and defects faster than ever before, and will help dramatically reduce the cost of non-quality in your IT projects.
